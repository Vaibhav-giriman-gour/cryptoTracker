# Setup and Deployment Guide for CryptoTracker

This guide will walk you through setting up, running, and deploying the CryptoTracker application.

## 1. Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

* **Node.js:** Version 18 or higher (includes npm). You can download it from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).
* **Git:** For cloning the repository.

## 2. Getting Started (Local Development)

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone <your-repository-url> # Replace with your actual repository URL
    cd crypto-tracker
    ```

2.  **Install Frontend Dependencies:**
    Navigate to the `frontend` directory and install the required Node.js packages:
    ```bash
    cd frontend
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Obtain CoinMarketCap API Key:**
    * Go to the [CoinMarketCap API website](https://coinmarketcap.com/api/) and sign up for a free developer account.
    * Generate your API Key.

4.  **Configure Environment Variables:**
    Create a `.env` file in the `frontend` directory (at the same level as `package.json`).
    ```bash
    # frontend/.env
    VITE_COINMARKETCAP_API_KEY=YOUR_API_KEY_HERE
    ```
    **Replace `YOUR_API_KEY_HERE` with the API key you obtained from CoinMarketCap.**

5.  **Run the Frontend Application:**
    Once dependencies are installed and the `.env` file is configured, start the development server:
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
    The application will typically be available at `http://localhost:5173` (or another port if 5173 is in use).

## 3. Building for Production

To create a production-ready build of the frontend application:

1.  **Navigate to the `frontend` directory:**
    ```bash
    cd frontend
    ```
2.  **Build the application:**
    ```bash
    npm run build
    ```
    This command will compile and optimize your React application into the `dist` directory within the `frontend` folder. The `dist` folder contains all the static files (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) ready for deployment.

## 4. Deployment

The `dist` folder generated by `npm run build` contains a static web application. You can deploy this folder to any static site hosting service.

Popular options include:

* **Netlify:** Drag and drop your `dist` folder, or connect your Git repository.
* **Vercel:** Similar to Netlify, easy deployment from Git.
* **GitHub Pages:** Host directly from a GitHub repository.
* **Firebase Hosting:** If you have a Firebase project.
* **AWS S3 + CloudFront:** For scalable cloud hosting.

**Example Deployment (Netlify/Vercel):**
1.  Push your code to a Git repository (GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket).
2.  Connect your repository to Netlify or Vercel.
3.  Configure the build settings:
    * **Build command:** `npm run build`
    * **Publish directory:** `frontend/dist`
4.  Deploy!

## 5. Tests

Automated tests (unit, integration, end-to-end) are crucial for production-ready applications. **This version of the application does not include automated tests.**

**Future Considerations for Testing:**
* **Unit Tests:** Using Jest and React Testing Library for individual components and Redux slices.
* **Integration Tests:** Testing the interaction between components and Redux store.
* **End-to-End Tests:** Using Cypress or Playwright to simulate user flows across the entire application.
