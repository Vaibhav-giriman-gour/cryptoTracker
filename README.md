# CryptoTracker: Real-time Cryptocurrency Tracking & Conversion üìà

## Project Overview

CryptoTracker is a modern, responsive web application designed to provide users with up-to-date cryptocurrency market data and a convenient tool for currency conversion. Built with a focus on performance and user experience, it leverages the power of React, Redux Toolkit, and Tailwind CSS for the frontend, and a Node.js Express server as a secure backend API proxy.

The application fetches the latest cryptocurrency listings from the CoinMarketCap API, displays them in a paginated format, and allows users to convert amounts between various cryptocurrencies and fiat currencies (like USD).

## Live Demo üöÄ

*Note: The backend API key is on a free tier which might have 'personal use' limitations that could occasionally affect consistent access in a shared environment.*

## Features ‚ú®

* **Cryptocurrency Listings:** View a list of top cryptocurrencies with their current price, 24-hour, and 7-day percentage changes.
* **Frontend Pagination:** Efficiently browse through large datasets of cryptocurrencies with smooth "Next" and "Previous" page navigation.
* **Crypto Converter:** Convert amounts between any two listed cryptocurrencies or between a cryptocurrency and USD.
* **Responsive Design:** Optimized for seamless viewing and interaction across various devices (mobile, tablet, desktop) using Tailwind CSS.
* **Modern State Management:** Utilizes Redux Toolkit for predictable and centralized application state management.
* **User-Friendly Notifications:** Employs `react-hot-toast` for non-intrusive success, error, and validation messages.
* **Optimized Performance:** Implements lazy loading for route-based components to improve initial page load times and `React.memo` for efficient component re-renders.
* **Secure API Key Handling:** Utilizes a Node.js backend proxy to securely manage the CoinMarketCap API key, preventing its exposure on the client-side.

## Technologies Used üõ†Ô∏è

### Frontend
* **React.js:** A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
* **Vite:** A fast frontend build tool that provides a lightning-fast development experience.
* **Redux Toolkit:** The official, opinionated, batteries-included toolset for efficient Redux development.
* **React Router:** For declarative routing within the Single Page Application (SPA).
* **Tailwind CSS:** A utility-first CSS framework for rapid and custom UI development.
* **Axios:** A promise-based HTTP client for making API requests.
* **`react-hot-toast`:** A library for beautiful and accessible toast notifications.

### Backend
* **Node.js:** A JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine.
* **Express.js:** A fast, unopinionated, minimalist web framework for Node.js.
* **Axios:** A promise-based HTTP client for making API requests to CoinMarketCap.
* **`dotenv`:** For loading environment variables from a `.env` file.
* **`cors`:** Middleware to enable Cross-Origin Resource Sharing.
* **`winston`:** A versatile logging library for robust server-side logging.

### API
* **CoinMarketCap API:** Provides comprehensive cryptocurrency data, including listings and conversion rates.

## Architecture & Design Choices üèóÔ∏è

The CryptoTracker application follows a modern full-stack architecture with a clear separation of concerns, focusing on performance and security.

* **Frontend (React & Redux Toolkit):** The client-side application handles the user interface, state management, and makes API calls exclusively to its own backend proxy. This approach optimizes user experience by rendering quickly in the browser.
* **Backend API Proxy (Node.js & Express.js):** A dedicated Node.js Express server acts as a secure intermediary between the frontend and the CoinMarketCap API.
    * **API Key Security:** The CoinMarketCap API key is stored and used solely on the backend, preventing its exposure in the client-side code.
    * **CORS Management:** The backend handles Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS), allowing the frontend to securely communicate with it.
    * **Centralized API Logic:** All external API interaction logic resides on the server, making it easier to manage, monitor, and scale.
* **Centralized State Management (Redux Toolkit):** All global application state (cryptocurrency data, loading status, errors, conversion results, pagination details) is managed within a Redux store, ensuring a single source of truth and predictable state changes.
* **Optimized Data Fetching:**
    * For cryptocurrency listings, the application fetches a larger dataset (e.g., 100 items) from the CoinMarketCap API **once** on initial load via the backend proxy.
    * **Frontend Pagination:** Instead of making new API calls for every page change, pagination is handled entirely on the frontend by slicing the already fetched data stored in the Redux store. This significantly reduces network requests and improves responsiveness when navigating between pages.
* **Code Splitting & Lazy Loading (`React.lazy`, `Suspense`):** To enhance initial load performance, route-based components are lazy-loaded. Their JavaScript bundles are only fetched when the user navigates to those specific routes, minimizing the initial download size.
* **Memoization (`React.memo`):** Components are wrapped with `React.memo` to prevent unnecessary re-renders if their props haven't changed, optimizing rendering performance.
* **Styling (Tailwind CSS):** Tailwind's utility-first approach allows for highly customizable and responsive designs directly within the JSX.
